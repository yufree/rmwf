# Demo data

```{r}
path <- system.file("demodata/untarget", package = "rmwf")
files <- list.files(path,recursive = T,full.names = T)
ST000560pos <- enviGCMS::getmzrtcsv(files[grepl('ST000560mzrt',files)])
```

# Remove the redundant peaks

```{r}
# check the paired mass distance relationship
pmd <- pmd::getpaired(ST000560pos)
pmd::plotpaired(pmd)
```

Here we could see some common PMDs within the same retention time bins like 21.98Da for the mass differences between [M+Na] and [M+H]. Other PMDs might refer to in-source reaction such as PMD 2.02Da for opening or forming of double bond. Another common kinds of PMDs should the homologous series compounds which could not be separated by the column such as PMD 14.02Da for CH2, PMD 28.03Da for C2H4, PMD 44.03Da for C3H6, and 56.05Da for C4H8, as well as 58.04Da for C3H6O. There are also some PMDs which highly depended on the the samples' matrix. Anyway, we will check those high frequency PMD considering isotopes, as well as multiple chargers to extract one peak for one potential compound. Such algorithm is called GlobalStd. The advantage of GlobalStd is that no pre-defined paired mass distances list is needed to remove redundant peaks. When a PMD always appeared in certain samples, it will be treated as potential adducts to be removed.

```{r}
std <- pmd::getstd(pmd)
pmd::plotstd(std)
```

In this case, we get 205 peaks for 205 potential compounds. Now we could retain those peaks for reactomics analysis.

```{r}
# generate new peak list and matrix sample
peakstd <- enviGCMS::getfilter(std,rowindex = std$stdmassindex)
```

GlobalStd algorithm was originally designed to retrieve independent peaks by the paired mass distances relationship among features without a predefined adducts or neutral loss list. However, the peaks from the same compounds should also be correlated with each other. Meanwhile, the independent peaks selection might still have peaks from the same compounds when the peaks' high frequency PMDs are not independent. In this case, the GlobalStd algorithm could set a cutoff to re-check the independent peaks by their relationship with potential PMDs groups and select the base peaks for the clusters of peaks.

Meanwhile, network analysis could be used for PMDDA workflow to select precursor ion for MS/MS annotation. Such precursor ions was selected by checking the peak with highest intensity of each independent peaks' high frequency PMD network cluster, which could be treated as pseudo spectra.

# Reactomics Network Analysis

The relation among those peaks could be checked in two ways: one from the correlation analysis and another from the PMD analysis. If we combined them together, reactomics network could be generated to capture the major reaction network within the samples. We will check them step by step.

## Build the correlation network

```{r}
library(igraph)
cutoff <- 0.9
metacor <- stats::cor(t(peakstd$data))
metacor[abs(metacor)<cutoff] <- 0
df <- data.frame(from=rownames(peakstd$data)[which(lower.tri(metacor), arr.ind = T)[, 1]],to=rownames(peakstd$data)[which(lower.tri(metacor), arr.ind = T)[, 2]],cor=metacor[lower.tri(metacor)])
df <- df[abs(df$cor)>0,]
df$direction <- ifelse(df$cor>0,'positive','negative')
net <- igraph::graph_from_data_frame(df,directed = F)
netc <- igraph::components(net)
message(paste(netc$no, 'metabolites correlation network clusters found'))
index <- rep(NA,length(rownames(peakstd$data)))
index[match(names(netc$membership),rownames(peakstd$data))] <- netc$membership
message(paste(sum(is.na(index)), 'out of', length(rownames(peakstd$data)), 'metabolites have no correlation with other metabolites'))
plot(net,vertex.label=NA,vertex.size =5,edge.width = 3, main = 'Correlation network')
```

Here we could see the correlation among those peaks as network. 111 peaks have relations with each others and 95 peaks were single.

## Build the PMD network

```{r}
peaksda <- pmd::getsda(peak,freqcutoff = 8)
df <- peaksda$sda
df$from <- paste0('M',round(df$ms1,4),'T',round(df$rt1,1))
df$to <- paste0('M',round(df$ms2,4),'T',round(df$rt2,1))
net <- graph_from_data_frame(df[,c('from','to','diff2')],directed = F)
netc <- igraph::components(net)
message(paste(netc$no, 'metabolites PMD network clusters found'))
index <- rep(NA,length(rownames(peakstd$data)))
index[match(names(netc$membership),rownames(peakstd$data))] <- netc$membership
message(paste(sum(is.na(index)), 'out of', length(rownames(peakstd$data)), 'metabolites have no PMD relations with other metabolites'))
pal <- grDevices::rainbow(8)
plot(net,vertex.label=NA,vertex.size =5,edge.width = 3,edge.color = pal[as.numeric(as.factor(E(net)$diff2))], main = 'PMD network')
legend("topright",bty = "n",
       legend=unique(E(net)$diff2),
       fill=unique(pal[as.numeric(as.factor(E(net)$diff2))]), border=NA,horiz = F)
unique(E(net)$diff2)
```

By checking the high frequency PMD relation, we see a similar while different results. Those high frequency PMDs could also be linked to potential reactions such as 0Da for isomers, 2.02Da for double bonds breaking/forming. Such PMDs could reveal the major reactions found among the metabolites. 65 peaks have PMDs relations with each others and 141 peaks were single.

Here we need to define a frequency cutoff. With the increasing number of high frequency PMDs cutoff, the ions cluster numbers would firstly increase then decrease. At the very beginning, the increasing numbers will include more information because high frequency PMDs always capture real reactions or structures relationships among compounds. Low frequency PMDs will introduce limited information as they might be generated by random differences among ions. In terms of network analysis, when the high frequency PMD cutoff is small, the network clusters will be small. However, when the numbers of network clusters are not increasing any more with more PMDs included, the relationship information among ions will not increase and the cutoff could be automated detected by GlobalStd algorithm. In detail, the algorithm will try to include PMDs one by one starting from the highest frequency PMDs. Meanwhile, the ions cluster numbers were recorded for the generated network among independent peaks and the cutoff will be the PMDs list with the largest number of independent peaks' network cluster.

## Build the PMD network with correlation

We could combine the PMD relation with correlation together to show the quantitative reactomics networks within the samples. Those metabolites could be quantitatively checked among different samples.

```{r}
peaksda <- pmd::getsda(peak,freqcutoff = 8,corcutoff = 0.6)
df <- peaksda$sda
df$from <- paste0('M',round(df$ms1,4),'T',round(df$rt1,1))
df$to <- paste0('M',round(df$ms2,4),'T',round(df$rt2,1))
net <- graph_from_data_frame(df[,c('from','to','diff2')],directed = F)
netc <- igraph::components(net)
message(paste(netc$no, 'metabolites quantitative reactomics network clusters found'))
index <- rep(NA,length(rownames(peakstd$data)))
index[match(names(netc$membership),rownames(peakstd$data))] <- netc$membership
message(paste(sum(is.na(index)), 'out of', length(rownames(peakstd$data)), 'metabolites have no PMD&correlation relations with other metabolites'))
net <- graph_from_data_frame(peaksda$sda,directed = F)
pal <- grDevices::rainbow(21)
plot(net,vertex.label=NA,vertex.size =5,edge.width = 3,edge.color = pal[as.numeric(as.factor(E(net)$diff2))], main = 'Quantitative reactomics network')
legend("topright",bty = "n",
       legend=unique(E(net)$diff2),
       fill=unique(pal[as.numeric(as.factor(E(net)$diff2))]), border=NA,horiz = F)
```

# Source appointment

If one compound have no relation with other metabolites, it might come from environment. On the other hand, endogenous compounds would always show PMD with other compounds. In this case, we could use such phenomena to check the metabolites' source. The largest network cluster should be endogenous network and If one metabolite is located in a network with nodes lower than 3, few reactions could be related and such compounds should be from environment.

```{r}
peaksda <- pmd::getsda(peak,freqcutoff = 8)
df <- peaksda$sda
df$from <- paste0('M',round(df$ms1,4),'T',round(df$rt1,1))
df$to <- paste0('M',round(df$ms2,4),'T',round(df$rt2,1))
net <- graph_from_data_frame(df[,c('from','to','diff2')],directed = F)
netc <- igraph::components(net)
# the largest one for endogenous compounds
idx <- which.max(netc$csize)
# the smaller one for exogenous compounds
idx1 <- which(netc$csize<4)
li <- igraph::groups(netc)
li[idx]
li[idx1]
```

Here we could find a cluster with 21 metabolites and another small clusters with fewer than 4 metabolites.

Another way to find endogenous and exogenous compounds could depend on the average degree of the whole network.

```{r}
deg <- degree(net, mode = 'all')
median(deg)
endogenous <- names(deg)[deg>median(deg)]
exogenous <- names(deg)[deg<=median(deg)]
endogenous
exogenous
```

# High toxicity compounds screen

However, if one compound is shown in a network with average distance between 4 and the largest cluster, such compound should be carefully checked for medium reactivates in the sample, which might be linked to a higher toxicity.

```{r}
# Suspcious compounds
idx2 <- which(netc$csize>3)
li[setdiff(idx2,idx)]
```

Here we find two clusters with potential higher toxicity.
